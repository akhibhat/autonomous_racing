# Wall Follow Algorithm

In this package, we implement a straightforward wall follow algorithm, such that the car follows the left wall while going around the race track.

## Usage

You can launch the simulator with the wall follow node with the command `roslaunch akhilesh_wallfollow wall_follower.launch`. If you want to launch AEB as well, you can use the command `roslaunch akhilesh_wallfollow safety_wall_follower.launch`.

## Dependencies
- sensor_msgs
- ackermann_msgs
- f110_simulator
